I have a lot of code snippets in my blog posts. At first I was copying the code into the markdown code blocks from the file itself- obviously this becomes tedious as the code I'm showcasing can become outdated quite quickly.

**Is there a way to import files into MDX files and render them as code blocks? Yes.**

```markdown filepath="components/examples/markdown-import-file.txt"

```

We will assume you have `nextjs` and `mdx` set up in your project. If not, you can follow the [official documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages) to set up a new project.

## Install dependencies

```bash
npm install path fs next-mdx-remote remark-gfm rehype-prism-plus unified unist-util-visit unist @types/unist @types/mdast
```

Create new file somewhere in your project called `markdown-renderer.tsx`. I put mine on the root in a folder called `/plugins/`

```ts filepath="plugins/remarkCodeImport.ts"

```

Make a new react compononent that will render the code block.

```tsx filepath="components/examples/markdown-renderer.tsx"

```

The important part is the `require("@/plugins/remarkCodeImport").default,` which will import the plugin we created earlier.

The use the new component `MarkdownRenderer` in your MDX file.

```tsx
export default function Page({ params }: PostPageProps) {
  const post: PostMeta = getPostBySlug(params.slug);

  return (
    <div className="space-y-8">
      <div className="space-y-2">
        <H1>{post.title}</H1>
        <P>{post.date}</P>
      </div>
      {/* Render the MDX content */}
      <div className="space-y-4">
        <MarkdownRenderer content={post.content} />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
```

In your `.mdx` files, you can now import files like so:

```markdown filepath="components/examples/markdown-import-file.txt"

```

This will import the code for any file in your project and render it as a code block in your MDX file.

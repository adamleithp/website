Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows you to build custom designs without writing any CSS.
When creating custom classes in Tailwind CSS, you may run into issues where some classes are lost when merging utility classes.
This is because Tailwind CSS has a set of default class groups that are used to merge utility classes.

For example, if you have a custom class that starts with `text-`, it will be removed when merging utility classes.

Tailwind-merge doesn't know that your custom `text-biggest` class is a text class, so it will
remove it when merging utility classes when a similar `text-xs` or `text-bg-red-500` is present.

This is a [known limitation](https://github.com/dcastil/tailwind-merge/blob/v2.3.0/docs/limitations.md) of `tailwind-merge`, but you can work around it by extending the `twMerge` function to include your custom class groups.

In this article, we will look at how to merge utility classes when create custom classes in Tailwind CSS with tailwind-merge and mergeConfigs().

## Adding custom classes to Tailwind CSS

```js
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    // ...
  ],
  theme: {
    fontSize: {
      smallest: [".625rem", { lineHeight: ".9375rem" }],
      biggest: ["4.5rem", { lineHeight: "5.625rem" }],
    },
  },
};
```

### Before

Normal `twMerge` behaviour with custom utilities and it's output:

```tsx
twMerge("font-bold text-gray-800 text-biggest") => "font-bold text-biggest"
```

> you can see that the `text-gray-800` class is lost.

### After

Our new `twMerge` function with custom class groups:

```tsx
twMerge("font-bold text-gray-800 text-biggest") => "font-bold text-gray-800 text-biggest"
```

> Create a new file `classes.helpers.ts` in your project.

```ts
import {
  createTailwindMerge,
  getDefaultConfig,
  mergeConfigs,
} from "tailwind-merge";

// Extends twMerge to allow for custom class groups
export const twMerge = createTailwindMerge(() =>
  mergeConfigs(getDefaultConfig(), {
    classGroups: {
      text: [
        {
          text: ["smallest", "biggest"],
        },
      ],
    },
  })
);
```

Now instead of importing `twMerge` from `tailwind-merge`, you can import it from your `classes.helpers.ts` file.

```tsx
import { twMerge } from "./classes.helpers";

export function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div className={twMerge("font-bold text-gray-800 text-biggest")}>
      Hello world
    </div>
  );
}
```

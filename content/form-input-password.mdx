It's common to add complexity to our simple html `input` fields. We can add buttons,
icons, labels, and other elements to make our forms more user-friendly. Here we will build
a password field with a toggle button to show/hide the password.

We add a simple button + icon to the right of an input field. The user can toggle the visibility of the password.

We will build upon Shadcn's [input](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/input), [button](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/button) & [label](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/label) to create a more complex input field.

<div className="max-w-64">
  <InputPassword />
</div>

Super simple, but some important things to note:

- [markup] The input and button is wrapped in an element which is `position: relative` so the button is position over the input.
- [markup] Whole component is wrapped in a label, so either clicking the label or the button will focus the input field, as-well as the input itself.
- [styling] Add padding-right to the input field to make space for the button, and so our text doesn't overlap the button.
- [accessibility] Use `aria-label` to describe the button's purpose.
- [accessibility] Use `aria-pressed` to indicate the state of the button.
- [accessibility] Use `aria-controls` to link the button to the input field.

Pricing cards are a common component on websites. They are used to display different pricing options for a product or service. In this article, we will create an accessible pricing card using React, Typescript, [React Hook Form, (RHF)](https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form) and [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/components/radio-group).

## Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-radio-group
```

## Create custom radio-group and radio group item component

We want to keep these components separate from the pricing card component. This will make it easier to reuse them in other components.

> Create new file `radio-group.tsx` somewhere in your components folder.

```tsx filepath="components/examples/pricing-form/radio-group.tsx"

```

> Create new file `radio-group-item.tsx` somewhere in your components folder.

```tsx filepath="components/examples/pricing-form/radio-group-item.tsx"

```

Now that we have our custom Radio Group components, we can create our form and pricing card components.

## Create pricing form component

Firstly, let's set up our mock data.

> Create a new `.ts` file somewhere:

```tsx filepath="components/examples/pricing-form/pricing-data.ts"

```

Then, let's build out the DOM elements of our form, then add in the functionality after.

> Create new file `pricing-form.tsx` somewhere in your components folder.

```tsx filepath="components/examples/pricing-form/pricing-form-just-dom.tsx"

```

Here's what it looks like, without any functionality or card styles:

<ElementShowcase>
  <PricingFormJustDom />
</ElementShowcase>

Working great, but not so much on the looks.

> Notice the default functionality of using the arrow keys to navigate the choices,
> this is, among other things, what makes this component accessible.

What we really want is a card-like design for our pricing options, and to remove the radio button indicator.

The great thing here, as long as we have this `RadioGroup` and `RadioGroupItem` components, we can style them however we want.

Back in our `pricing-form.tsx` file, start building out the card design.

```tsx filepath="components/examples/pricing-form/pricing-form-just-dom-and-card.tsx"

```

<ElementShowcase>
  <PricingFormJustDomWithCard />
</ElementShowcase>

Lovely, but we don't have an `active` state for the card, nor any way to manage the radio groups values.

## Final form with React Hook Form

To enable our `active` state in our card, we're going to add `react-hook-form`, `yup` & `@hookform/resolvers` to our project.

```bash
npm install react-hook-form yup @hookform/resolvers
```

```tsx filepath="components/examples/pricing-form/pricing-form-just-dom-and-card-rhf.tsx"

```

And some CSS to make it look a bit nicer:

````css
/* Focus styles */
.focus-element {
  @apply ring-offset-white
    transition-colors
    focus-within:outline-none
    focus-within:ring-2
    focus-within:ring-gray-950
    focus-within:ring-offset-2
    dark:ring-offset-gray-950
    dark:focus-within:ring-gray-300;
}

/* Visually hide something from document flow, but keep it accessible to screen readers: */
```css .visually-hidden {
  border: 0;
  clip: rect(0 0 0 0);
  clip-path: inset(50%);
  height: 1px;
  margin: -1px;
  overflow: hidden;
  padding: 0;
  position: absolute;
  width: 1px;
  white-space: nowrap; /* 1 */
}

.visually-hidden.focusable:active,
.visually-hidden.focusable:focus {
  clip: auto;
  clip-path: none;
  height: auto;
  margin: 0;
  overflow: visible;
  position: static;
  width: auto;
  white-space: inherit;
}
````

<ElementShowcase>
  <PricingFormJustDomWithCardWithRHF />
</ElementShowcase>

## Conclusion

In this article, we created an accessible pricing card using React, Typescript, React Hook Form, and Radix UI.
We also created custom radio group components to make the pricing card more accessible.
We used React Hook Form to manage the form state and validation.

Radix UI provides a set of primitives that make it easy to create accessible components.

This approach makes it easy to create accessible pricing cards (or any other radio-select-only-one-option component) that are easy to use and understand.

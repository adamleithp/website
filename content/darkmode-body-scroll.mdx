Browsers default background is white, so when we change our `<body>` or `<main>` background color, when scrolling and you hit the top or bottom of a page, the intertia bounce feature in modern OS' can lead to showing the `<html>` background color behind these elements.

This is easily circumvented by setting the background color of the `<html>` to the same color as the our element.

```css
html {
  background-color: ruby;
}
// Ensure the body has the same background color
body {
  background-color: ruby;
}
```

But in scenarios where matching the content to the `<html>` background color isn't possible, we can use a simple trick;

<img src="/bounce-cropped.gif" className="border border-gray-800 max-w-56" />

### ::before/::after pseudo-element

Let's imagine a scenario where we have a darkmode website, but we can't change the `<html>`'s background color. We can use a `::before` or `::after` pseudo-element positioned just right.

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <main>
      <!-- content -->
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
```

```css
main:before {
  content: "";
  position: fixed;
  left: 0;
  right: 0;
  width: 100vw;
  background-color: black;
  z-index: -1;

  // You can play with these values
  top: -30vh;
  height: 50vh;
}
```

This adds a pseudo-element which will sit behind our element, full width and offset above the top edge!

Also, for iOS, don't forget the `theme-color` meta tag, which will change the color of the top bar in Safari when scrolling.

```html
<meta name="theme-color" content="#000000" />
```

Acheived with the following viewport configuration in `nextjs`:

```tsx
export const viewport: Viewport = {
  themeColor: "black",
};
```
